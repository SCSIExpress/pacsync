# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Pacman Sync Utility is a distributed system designed to synchronize pacman packages and versions across multiple Arch-based distributions and computers. The system consists of a central server with a web UI for managing package pools and endpoint groups, and client applications that run on individual machines to handle synchronization operations. The system aims to maintain consistent package states across grouped endpoints while handling repository compatibility issues and providing intuitive desktop integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Central Server Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a central server with a web UI to manage package pools and endpoint groups, so that I can organize and control package synchronization across multiple machines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN the central server SHALL provide a web-based user interface accessible via HTTP
2. WHEN I access the web UI THEN the system SHALL allow me to create, edit, and delete package pools
3. WHEN I create a package pool THEN the system SHALL allow me to assign multiple endpoints to that pool
4. WHEN I manage endpoints THEN the system SHALL allow me to group endpoints and move them between different pools
5. WHEN I view a package pool THEN the system SHALL display all endpoints in that pool and their current sync status
6. WHEN the server is deployed THEN it SHALL be accessible remotely over HTTP for integration with reverse proxies and SSL termination

### Requirement 2: Database Support

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want flexible database options including external PostgreSQL or internal database support, so that I can choose the appropriate storage solution for my infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN the central server SHALL support connection to an external PostgreSQL database
2. WHEN no external database is configured THEN the system SHALL use an internal database solution
3. WHEN the database is initialized THEN the system SHALL create all necessary tables and schemas automatically
4. WHEN switching between database types THEN the system SHALL provide migration utilities to preserve existing data

### Requirement 3: Package Repository Analysis

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to analyze repository information from endpoints to exclude incompatible packages, so that synchronization only includes packages available across all repositories in a pool.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an endpoint connects THEN the client SHALL send its available pacman repository information to the central server
2. WHEN the central server receives repository data THEN it SHALL analyze package availability across all endpoints in each pool
3. WHEN performing synchronization THEN the system SHALL exclude packages that are not available in all repositories within the pool
4. WHEN repository information changes THEN the system SHALL automatically update the compatibility analysis
5. WHEN a package becomes unavailable in any repository THEN the system SHALL mark it as excluded from future synchronizations

### Requirement 4: Docker Support

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the central server to support Docker deployment, so that I can easily deploy and manage the service in containerized environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the system THEN the central server SHALL be available as a Docker container
2. WHEN using Docker THEN the system SHALL support environment variable configuration for database connections and other settings
3. WHEN running in Docker THEN the system SHALL persist data through volume mounts
4. WHEN scaling THEN the Docker container SHALL support horizontal scaling with proper database connection management

### Requirement 5: Desktop Client Integration

**User Story:** As an end user, I want a desktop client with system tray integration that shows sync status, so that I can monitor and control package synchronization from my desktop environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the client starts THEN it SHALL display an icon in the system tray using AppIndicator and KStatusNotifierItem protocols
2. WHEN the endpoint is in sync THEN the icon SHALL display a "synchronized" state
3. WHEN the endpoint has newer packages than the pool THEN the icon SHALL display an "ahead" state
4. WHEN the endpoint has older packages than the pool THEN the icon SHALL display a "behind" state
5. WHEN the sync status changes THEN the icon SHALL update automatically to reflect the new state

### Requirement 6: Desktop Client Actions

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to perform synchronization actions through the desktop client, so that I can manage package states without using command-line tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the system tray icon THEN the system SHALL display a context menu with available actions
2. WHEN I select "sync to latest" THEN the client SHALL update all packages to match the latest versions in the pool
3. WHEN I select "set as current latest" THEN the client SHALL mark the current package installation state as the new target for the pool
4. WHEN I select "revert to previous" THEN the client SHALL restore packages to the previous synchronized state
5. WHEN performing any action THEN the system SHALL provide progress feedback and error handling
6. WHEN an action completes THEN the system SHALL update the sync status and icon state accordingly

### Requirement 7: Cross-Endpoint Synchronization

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to perform synchronization actions from any endpoint in the pool, so that I can manage the entire pool's package state from any connected machine.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I perform a "set as current latest" action THEN all other endpoints in the pool SHALL be notified of the new target state
2. WHEN another endpoint updates the pool state THEN my client SHALL receive the update and reflect the new sync status
3. WHEN I perform a sync action THEN the central server SHALL coordinate the operation across all relevant endpoints
4. WHEN network connectivity is restored THEN pending synchronization actions SHALL be processed automatically

### Requirement 8: Command-Line Interface

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to execute synchronization commands directly via command-line arguments, so that I can integrate the client with external tools and automation scripts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the client with "--sync" argument THEN it SHALL perform a sync to latest operation and exit
2. WHEN I run the client with "--set-latest" argument THEN it SHALL set the current state as the pool's latest and exit
3. WHEN I run the client with "--revert" argument THEN it SHALL revert to the previous state and exit
4. WHEN I run the client with "--status" argument THEN it SHALL output the current sync status and exit
5. WHEN using command-line mode THEN the client SHALL provide appropriate exit codes for success/failure states
6. WHEN command-line operations complete THEN the system SHALL update the persistent sync status for the GUI client

### Requirement 9: WayBar Integration

**User Story:** As a WayBar user, I want the client to provide status information and click actions that work with WayBar, so that I can monitor and control package synchronization from my WayBar setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN queried by WayBar THEN the client SHALL output sync status in JSON format suitable for WayBar consumption
2. WHEN the sync status changes THEN the client SHALL provide updated information for WayBar to display
3. WHEN WayBar executes click actions THEN the client SHALL respond to the configured click commands
4. WHEN running in WayBar mode THEN the client SHALL provide appropriate text and tooltip information
5. WHEN WayBar requests status updates THEN the client SHALL respond efficiently without blocking the bar

### Requirement 10: Qt-based User Interface

**User Story:** As an end user, I want the desktop client to use Qt for native-looking windows and dialogs, so that the interface integrates well with my desktop environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the client needs to display detailed information THEN it SHALL use Qt widgets to create native-looking windows
2. WHEN showing progress or confirmation dialogs THEN the system SHALL use Qt dialog components
3. WHEN displaying package lists or sync details THEN the interface SHALL use appropriate Qt controls for data presentation
4. WHEN the client runs on different desktop environments THEN the Qt interface SHALL adapt to the native look and feel

### Requirement 11: Package State Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to track and manage package states across all endpoints, so that I can maintain consistent environments and handle rollbacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN packages are installed or updated THEN the client SHALL report the new state to the central server
2. WHEN a synchronization target is set THEN the system SHALL store the complete package state as a snapshot
3. WHEN reverting to a previous state THEN the system SHALL have access to historical package configurations
4. WHEN conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL provide resolution options and maintain data integrity
5. WHEN an endpoint is offline THEN the system SHALL queue synchronization operations for when it reconnects
