# Task 4.3 Implementation Summary

## Task: Implement synchronization operation API endpoints

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive synchronization operation API endpoints for the Pacman Sync Utility, including real-time status updates, operation progress tracking, and comprehensive error handling.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Core Sync Operation Endpoints

#### POST `/api/sync/{endpoint_id}/sync-to-latest`
- Triggers synchronization of endpoint to latest pool state
- Validates endpoint authentication and authorization
- Creates async operation with progress tracking
- Returns operation details immediately
- Sends real-time WebSocket updates

#### POST `/api/sync/{endpoint_id}/set-as-latest`
- Sets endpoint's current state as pool's target state
- Captures current package state as new synchronization target
- Updates all other endpoints in pool to "behind" status
- Provides operation tracking and status updates

#### POST `/api/sync/{endpoint_id}/revert`
- Reverts endpoint to previous package state
- Analyzes available historical states
- Performs rollback to previous known good state
- Tracks revert operation progress

### 2. Operation Status and Management

#### GET `/api/sync/operations/{operation_id}`
- Retrieves detailed operation status
- Provides progress information with percentage and current action
- Returns error details for failed operations
- Calculates progress based on operation stage

#### POST `/api/sync/operations/{operation_id}/cancel`
- Cancels pending synchronization operations
- Validates operation can be cancelled (only pending operations)
- Sends real-time cancellation notifications
- Updates operation status appropriately

### 3. Operation History and Listing

#### GET `/api/sync/{endpoint_id}/operations`
- Lists recent operations for specific endpoint
- Requires endpoint authentication (can only view own operations)
- Supports pagination with configurable limits
- Returns comprehensive operation details

#### GET `/api/sync/pools/{pool_id}/operations`
- Lists recent operations across all endpoints in pool
- Provides pool-wide operation visibility
- Supports administrative monitoring
- Includes operation filtering and sorting

### 4. Real-time Status Updates

#### WebSocket `/api/sync/{endpoint_id}/status`
- Provides real-time operation status updates
- Supports multiple concurrent connections per endpoint
- Handles connection lifecycle (connect/disconnect)
- Sends operation start, progress, completion, and error notifications
- Includes ping/pong for connection health monitoring

### 5. Connection Management

#### ConnectionManager Class
- Manages WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Tracks active connections per endpoint
- Handles connection failures gracefully
- Provides broadcast capabilities for operation updates
- Automatically cleans up disconnected connections

### 6. Comprehensive Error Handling

#### Validation Errors
- Endpoint not found or not in pool
- Active operation conflicts (prevents concurrent operations)
- Invalid operation parameters
- Authentication and authorization failures

#### Operation Errors
- Network connectivity issues
- Package manager failures
- State synchronization conflicts
- Database operation failures

#### HTTP Error Responses
- Structured error format with error codes
- Detailed error messages for debugging
- Appropriate HTTP status codes
- Timestamp and context information

### 7. Authentication and Authorization

#### Endpoint Authentication
- JWT token-based authentication for all operations
- Endpoint can only perform operations on itself
- Secure token validation and refresh
- Role-based access control integration

#### Operation Security
- Prevents unauthorized cross-endpoint operations
- Validates pool membership before operations
- Audit logging for all sync operations
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention

### 8. Progress Tracking and Logging

#### Operation Progress
- Real-time progress percentage calculation
- Current stage and action descriptions
- Estimated completion times
- Detailed operation logs

#### Status Stages
- `pending`: Operation queued for execution
- `in_progress`: Operation actively running
- `completed`: Operation finished successfully
- `failed`: Operation encountered errors

### 9. Concurrent Operation Management

#### Operation Locking
- Prevents multiple simultaneous operations per endpoint
- Queues operations when conflicts detected
- Provides clear error messages for conflicts
- Supports operation cancellation

#### Pool Coordination
- Coordinates operations across pool endpoints
- Manages state synchronization between endpoints
- Handles cross-endpoint notifications
- Maintains consistency during concurrent operations

```

### Data Models
- `SyncOperationRequest`: Request payload for operations
- `SyncOperationResponse`: Detailed operation information
- `OperationStatusResponse`: Status with progress details
- `OperationListResponse`: Paginated operation lists

### WebSocket Protocol
```json
{
  "type": "operation_started|operation_progress|operation_completed|operation_failed|operation_cancelled",
  "operation": { /* operation details */ },
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```
